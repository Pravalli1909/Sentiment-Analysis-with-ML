The sentiment analysis is part of natural language processing as it is needed to 
have the insight of the tone that is being communicated in textual data, which is 
from many sources like product reviews, social media posts or client responses.
We rely on the IMDb dataset to be able to carry out evaluations of the diversity of 
supervised learning classes--such as Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, 
Logistic Regression and Decision Trees--and choose the best model for sentiment 
classification.
This research has enhanced the field of sentimental analysis by pointing out that 
the supervised manner of learning models gives accurate outcomes when dealing 
with actual text in real time.
